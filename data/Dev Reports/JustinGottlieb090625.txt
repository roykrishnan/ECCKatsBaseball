Pitch Profile: 

Justin Refermat shows too large of a variation of his pitches, meaning his pitches are really inconsistent in their break profile, the good ones are solid, but the bad ones are non-competitive in the conferences and don't move as they should. Dialing in feel, and putting an emphasis on making his misses competitive will be imperative to him being an effective contributor.

Biomechanics Profile: 
Gottlieb would benefit from forward tilt with the torso at ball release, struggled to get over the front leg at ball release. This might natively come with creating more force in his strength profile from the ground up, as this has a tendency to naturally move the trunk forward in ball release to normalize said force.
